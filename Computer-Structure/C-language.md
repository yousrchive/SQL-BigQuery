# Computer Language and Communication

## Low-Level Language

- **Machine Language**: Represents instructions in binary digits (0s and 1s). It varies from CPU to CPU (e.g., 0101, 0111, 0100...).
  
- **Assembly Language**: A more readable representation of machine language using abbreviations (e.g., LDA, ADD, STA).

## High-Level Language

- **High-Level Languages**: User-friendly programming languages such as C, C++, C#, Java, and Python.

### Language Compilation Process

High-Level Language → Compiler → Assembly Language → CPU

## UNIX Development

- UNIX was developed before the advent of the C language.
- Initially written in Assembly language, which varies based on hardware architecture.
- The introduction of C language eliminated the need for CPU-specific development, as its structure is not dependent on the CPU.

## Characteristics of C Language

1. **Procedural Orientation**: Aligns with human thought processes.
2. **Portability**: No need for program rewriting based on CPU, providing excellent portability.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Efficient memory usage and performance enhancement by minimizing speed-reducing factors.
