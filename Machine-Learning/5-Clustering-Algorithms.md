# The 5 Clustering Algorithms Data Scientists Need to Know

Clustering is a Machine Learning technique that involves the grouping of data points. Given a set of data points, we can use a clustering algorithm to classify each data point into a specific group. In theory, data points that are in the same group should have similar properties and/or features, while data points in different groups should have highly dissimilar properties and/or features.

## Conclusion
There are your top 5 clustering algorithms that a data scientist should know! Weâ€™ll end off with an awesome visualization of how well these algorithms and a few others perform, courtesy of Scikit Learn! Very cool to see how the different algorithms compare and contrast with different data!
